# Summary App
Problem statement:<br>
Create an app which takes the name of a book as input. It then generates a 500 word summary of the book using Open AI API.

Sure, here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. `messages = [ {"text": prompt, "user": "user"}, {"text": "", "user": "AI"} ]`
    - This creates a list of two dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message exchanged between a user and an AI. The first dictionary contains the prompt passed to the `generate_response` function and specifies that the user is the speaker. The second dictionary contains an empty string and specifies that the AI is the speaker.

2. `response = openai.Completion.create(model="text-davinci-003", prompt=json.dumps(messages), temperature=0.5, max_tokens=1024, n=1, stop=None)`
    - This sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the prompt provided in `messages`. 
    - The `model` parameter specifies which pre-trained language model to use for the text generation. In this case, it's `text-davinci-003`.
    - The `prompt` parameter is a JSON-encoded string of the messages exchanged between the user and AI, which serves as the input to the language model.
    - The `temperature` parameter controls the degree of randomness in the generated text. A higher temperature value leads to more creative and unexpected text.
    - The `max_tokens` parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens (words or sub-words) that can be generated in the response.
    - The `n` parameter specifies the number of possible responses to generate. In this case, we only want one response, so `n=1`.
    - The `stop` parameter specifies a list of tokens at which to stop generating text. If `None`, the text generation will continue until reaching the `max_tokens` limit.
    - The `openai.Completion.create()` function returns a response object that contains a list of possible responses generated by the language model.

3. `return response.choices[0].text.strip()`
    - This extracts the first response choice from the response object returned by the OpenAI API and returns the generated text as a string, with any leading or trailing white space removed by calling `.strip()`.
